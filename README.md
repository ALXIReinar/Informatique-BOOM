**Informatique BOOM** This is the project with which I took a computer science session. I called it the "saving box"!

*```it was developed with the help of```***```pyperclip```***``` and ```***```colorama```***```libraries```*

## Required libraries ##

```python
pip install colorama
pip install pyperclip
```

**List of imports:**

```python
import pyperclip
from need_text import keys_themes
from need_text import search_words
```

## Note

* The infoCommand1() and infoCommand2() functions, which are executed when entering random data when ***selecting an action***, will help you figure out the valid data

## Usage examples

**Pic1** Search with num of theme

**Pic2.** Search with key word

## Features :wink:

* The main and CONVENIENT feature of this idea is that the result of the work is copied to the clipboard:see_no_evil:, which is cool when you can't sit in the development environment during the exam, but you can sit, for example, in a notebook))



**Example:**
![pic1](https://sun9-5.userapi.com/impg/bftLUPgDKpi57idjhpFqS1AYx6IuIQaocZJPlw/4r-YWZQsa3M.jpg?size=1920x1080&quality=95&sign=cb79ef76146ea7cdc8e136029835c7bf&type=album)




* And if there is no such need, the highlighted text in the output window will make it more comfortable to read the text - the merit of **Colorama**



Thanks for check this :innocent:
